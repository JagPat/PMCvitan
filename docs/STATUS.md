# STATUS

Machine-readable state for the autonomous runner. The runner reads this file to
decide what to do next and updates it after each merge. It is also the one place
a human can glance at to see where the loop is.

This file is authoritative for task state. `docs/ROADMAP.md` is historical
narrative and may lag behind reality.

## Phase 4 — labour readiness

Task numbering and definitions come from the "Required Execution Order and
Review Stops" section of the phase plan.

| Task | Summary | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Labour capability + type-routed demand + trusted workforce identity (§B/§D/§H) | merged |
| 2 | Supplier reuse + labour commitment documents (§F) | merged |
| 3 | Time-capacity conservation — commitment, allocation, attendance, actual-work facts (§C) | merged — correction round 3 merged as PR #230 (`main` `33d37a3`) through the exact-head `codex-current-head` gate; evidence `docs/reviews/phase-4-t3-correction3-packet.md` |
| 4 | Canonical labour coverage + Team gate + combined readiness + seventh projection + LEAF module graph (§A/§G) | merged — PR #242 merged at `main` `861b622` after two Codex correction rounds and a fresh clean +1 through the exact-head `codex-current-head` gate; evidence `docs/reviews/phase-4-t4-readiness-packet.md` |
| 5 | Daily-Log reconciliation (§E) + planned-vs-actual + productivity (§I) | merged — PR #245 merged at `main` `d8a9c50` with a fresh clean Codex +1 on the exact head `119816b` through the `codex-current-head` gate (twelve findings across three in-branch Codex rounds all fixed with reproduce-first probes); evidence `docs/reviews/phase-4-t5-reconciliation-packet.md` |
| 6 | Frontend surfaces + pilot acceptance chain + consolidated Phase-4 packet (§J) | in_progress — branch `claude/phase4-task6` from `main` `d8a9c50`; FINAL Phase-4 review stop |

## State values

- `not_started` — no branch, no PR
- `correction_required` — a reviewed merge has a validated defect; launch the
  named `blocking_directive` before any later task
- `in_progress` — branch exists, PR open as a draft, still being built
- `in_review` — PR open as a draft, waiting on a Codex review or on a fix for
  review findings
- `ready` — PR marked ready for review; the merge is queued behind CI
- `merged` — squash-merged to `main` and deployed

## Rules for the runner

- Work one task at a time. A correction keeps its parent task open. Do not open a
  PR for task N+1 while task N is not `merged`.
- **Open every PR as a draft with Claude Code web Auto-fix enabled.** The trusted
  GitHub workflow marks an exact CI-green head ready to trigger Codex. A finding
  returns it to draft; only the required exact-SHA `codex-current-head` status may
  queue auto-merge. A human ready/merge action is not review clearance.
- After a clean-reviewed merge: set that task to `merged`, set the next task to
  `in_progress`, update `open_pr` and `updated`. If post-merge review finds a
  defect, return the parent task to `in_progress` and name its blocking directive.
- When every task in a phase is `merged`, move to the next phase's plan and start
  at its task 1.
- Update this file in the same PR as the work it describes, so state and code
  never disagree on `main`.
