## Vision Alignment

- User decisions improved:
  - the **PMC** switching between sites always operates on exactly one project's records — a decision issued, an inspection reviewed or a member removed lands on the site on screen, never a stale one (Tasks 2, 3);
  - the **client** approving a decision sees only their own project's facts — a blank project shows honest absence, never Ambli sample photos, fixed counts or a fake "report generated" success (Task 7);
  - the **site engineer** records attendance, materials and progress against real calendar days in the site's time zone — "latest daily log" is chosen by the civil day, correct across month/year boundaries (Task 6);
  - a **removed team member** loses access on their very next request, not at token expiry (Task 4).
- Canonical fact owners: the `Project` row owns identity and the schedule anchor (`scheduleStartDate`); each operational record (`Decision`, `Activity`, `Inspection`, `DailyLog`, `Drawing`, `Media`) is owned by exactly one project via `projectId`; the civil-date DATE columns are the canonical dates and legacy display strings/int offsets are derived compatibility artifacts; `Membership` (+ org role) is the canonical access grant, re-checked live per request.
- Information flows protected: server snapshot → store (generation-guarded, never a stale project's reply); decision status → activity Decision gate (derived live, never stored); membership change → next-request authorization (live re-check); URL ↔ store (an actual URL change is a navigation request; a store-initiated switch rewrites the stale URL — no ping-pong, proven by `history preserves scope and screen`).
- Human approvals preserved: client consent stays an attributable decision approval (`Decision.approver` + `DecisionEvent`, untouched by Phase 0); technical acceptance stays the PMC's inspection decide; certification/payment authority is not modelled yet — Phase 0 introduced no surrogate for any human approval.

## Schema and Migration Evidence

- Migrations (Phase 0):
  - `20260902000000_phase0_project_integrity/migration.sql` — sha256 `bf2b7b9362442892946173516d92880b551bbd705b58ef8d6b9d8819ffc1ab09`
  - `20260903000000_phase0_real_dates/migration.sql` — sha256 `da19c04b8305d91ac97f0586bc5303d5bb0f860b210aa3808d0e618a4030fb45`
  - `20260905000000_phase0_tenant_constraints/migration.sql` (remediation round 1) — sha256 `eee06929c7776873eef4324ad0a11b1313b1d223efce99118fa85bb3ca193e74`
- Diagnostic query output (seeded acceptance DB `pmcvitan_e2e`, 2026-07-12T22:13Z):

  ```text
  cross-project Media.decisionId: 0
  cross-project Drawing.activityId: 0
  cross-project Activity.decisionId: 0
  unparseable Project.projStart: 0
  unparseable DailyLog.date: 0
  ```

- Fresh-database result: `prisma migrate deploy` onto empty `pmcvitan_e2e` — all 20 migrations applied, exit 0 (2026-07-12, local; the same runs green in the CI `api` and `api-e2e` jobs).
- Existing-data-copy result (Task 6, 2026-07-12): all migrations except `real_dates` applied, legacy-shape demo rows inserted via SQL, then `prisma migrate deploy` — exit 0 with every backfill asserted (ambli anchor `2026-06-01`, ACT-31 `2026-07-05→2026-07-12`, `logDate 2026-07-03`, loose inspection dates left NULL). Corrupt-copy refusal: a project with `projStart='July 3rd, 2026'` aborts deploy with `phase0_real_dates: 1 Project.projStart value(s) unparseable — fix by hand before migrating` (non-zero exit).
- Rollback boundary: restore the prior application build and keep the additive schema; constraints are never auto-reverted after dependent writes — repairs are operator-reviewed forward migrations. Frontend Tasks 2/3/7 roll back as one compatible group. (Documented in `docs/DEPLOY.md` → "Phase 0 release runbook".)

## Security and Tenancy Evidence

- Removed membership: integration `live project access (integration) › rejects a previously issued token after membership removal` + acceptance `removed membership revokes token` (same unexpired JWT: 200 before removal → 403 after; re-login 401) — both pass.
- Archived project: integration `live project access (integration) › rejects access to an archived project` — passes.
- Cross-project route: integration `live project access (integration) › tenant isolation: a project-B member's token cannot read project A (and vice versa)` + acceptance `non-member is forbidden` (API `GET /projects/test-empty-site/snapshot` → 403, `POST /auth/switch` → 403; UI never offers or requests Project B) — both pass.
- Cross-project reference: integration `project reference integrity (database constraints) › PostgreSQL rejects a drawing in project B pointing at project A records (P2003)` (+ the media variant, the same-project control, and `deleting an activity unlinks referencing drawings`) + acceptance `cross-project reference is rejected` (a Project B drawing naming Project A's `ACT-31` → 400, no row created) — all pass.
- Org owner path: integration `live project access (integration) › allows an org owner to operate an active project in the same org as pmc (no membership row)` — passes.

## Verification

- `pnpm check` — 2026-07-12T22:12:02Z, exit 0: web lint + typecheck + **163** unit tests + build; api generate + typecheck + **278** unit tests + build.
- `pnpm --filter api test:integration` — 2026-07-12T22:13:13Z, exit 0: **13/13** on PostgreSQL 16 (`pmcvitan_test`).
- `pnpm test:e2e:api` — 2026-07-12T22:13:34Z, exit 0: **8/8** scenarios (`project-scope.spec.ts`) against the compiled API + seeded PostgreSQL (`pmcvitan_e2e`), 17.1s.
- `git diff --check` — clean (no whitespace errors).
- CI run URL (Task 8, head `bc90390`, all jobs incl. `api-e2e` green): <https://github.com/JagPat/PMCvitan/actions/runs/29211240865> (pull_request) and <https://github.com/JagPat/PMCvitan/actions/runs/29211218437> (push).

## Independent Review — Round 1 (Codex) and Remediation

The independent Codex review of PR #88 did **not** clear the gate (7 findings; full
review attached to [PR #88](https://github.com/JagPat/PMCvitan/pull/88#issuecomment-4953051607)).
Every finding was verified against the code and remediated in four focused PRs on
branch `claude/vitan-pmc-design-epa2rp`:

| Findings | Remediation | Proof |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (outbox replay), 3 (unguarded raw-DTO replies), 6 (session identity not in scope) | `fix: pin server replies to their scope and session` | `apps/web/tests/scope-identity.test.ts` (6 scenarios, failing-first) |
| 2 (removed member kept global-delete access) | `security: live-authorize global-scoped routes` | `test/integration/global-route-authz.test.ts` (reproduced 200 → fixed 403) |
| 4 (node/phase/material single-column FKs) | `security: complete database tenant constraints` + migration `20260905000000_phase0_tenant_constraints` | `test/integration/tenant-constraints.test.ts` (raw-SQL forgeries rejected; controls pass); corrupt-copy refusal proven |
| 5 (date validation/writes), 7 (evidence gaps) | `fix: validate canonical dates end to end` + this packet update | contract tests (impossible dates, reversed windows, junk time zones → 400); phases now write real dates |

The full independent gate must re-run on the merged remediation head.

## Known Residual Risks

| Risk | Owner | Follow-up |
|---|---|---|
| The web session token is memory-only: a refresh returns to the sign-in gate (deep links survive re-auth, proven by `deep link survives token switch`). Deliberate for Phase 0; session persistence is a product decision. | PMCvitan maintainer | Evaluate refresh-token/session persistence in a later phase |
| The seeded demo password (`vitan123` default) also protects the `test-*` fixture users; the seed is dev/test-only and must never run against production (runner refuses without an explicit `DATABASE_URL`). | PMCvitan maintainer | Rotate/disable demo credentials before any shared staging environment |
| `apps/api` `start:dev` (tsx watch) cannot boot Nest DI (decorator metadata); dev serving uses the compiled `node dist/main.js` (as the acceptance harness does). | PMCvitan maintainer | Fix or replace the `start:dev` script in a later housekeeping change |
