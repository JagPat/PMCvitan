/**
 * Phase 4 Task 1 — the LABOUR module (plan §§B/G/H): trusted workforce identity + the labour
 * requirement detail. A LEAF, exactly like `inventory` (round-3 acyclicity correction):
 * `dependsOn: []` — Labour never synchronously reads Activities, Procurement or Decisions.
 *
 * It OWNS the labour catalog (`LabourTrade`/`LabourSkill`), the trusted `Worker`/`Crew`/
 * `CrewMembership` identity, and the labour requirement detail (`LabourRequirementSpec` +
 * `LabourDemandSlice`). The labour detail is written THROUGH `LabourRequirementParticipant`,
 * invoked by the Activities requirement command inside its transaction — the cycle-exempt
 * `activities → labour` workflow-participant edge (so `activities.workflowParticipants` includes
 * `labour`; Labour's own `workflowParticipants` stays empty in Task 1 — it invokes no other
 * module's participant here). Onboarding is `pmc` authority; the register read is pmc/engineer.
 *
 * Task 1 emits NO domain event: onboarding is a roster surface (attributable via `recordAudit`,
 * idempotent via the command ledger). Labour capacity facts (allocation/attendance/work) — and
 * their event family — arrive in Tasks 3–5. The `requirement.*` events that carry the labour
 * demand stay Activities-owned (a discriminated `type` payload); Labour's async
 * `consumesEvents` read-model + the coverage read edge land in Task 4, not here.
