/**
 * Phase 6 unit 4c-iii-r — the DEPLOY-TIME, ONE-SHOT `decisions.inbox` repair.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. 4c-iii's enablement transition ran while the `phase-6-4c-previous-release-drained`
 * prerequisite was unmet, so a pre-4c-ii worker may have written a `decisions.inbox` generation that
 * holds a non-empty SUBSET of the canonical register while presenting as caught-up. The read path
 * serves such a generation as authoritative until the next decision event, and no audit can
 * establish which projects it touched — so the register is rebuilt from canonical for EVERY
 * project. Making that a property of the deployment rather than a step a person performs and
 * reports is the whole point of the unit: the loop clears its own directive.
 *
 * WHERE IT RUNS. `scripts/migrate.sh`, on BOTH success paths, AFTER `prisma migrate deploy` and its
 * seal verifications and BEFORE `node dist/main.js` starts — as the COMPILED artifact
 * `dist/platform/projections/inbox-repair.cli.js`, the same fail-closed pattern the preflights use.
 * Because it runs before the server accepts connections, the CLIENT REFRESH IS STRUCTURAL: the
 * container restart that carries this deploy disconnects every client and `useApiSync` refreshes on
 * socket `connect`, so no client can hold a stale view across the deploy.
 *
 * THE THREE PROPERTIES IT MUST HAVE, and how each is obtained.
 *
 * 1. EXACTLY ONCE ACROSS CONCURRENT REPLICA STARTS — by a lock, not by reading a marker. Two
 *    replacement containers starting together can both read the marker as absent before either
 *    writes it, and `ProjectionRebuilder` allocates `generation = max + 1` per (consumer, project)
 *    inside its own transaction with NO cross-process serialization: the second insert violates the
 *    generation unique key, and across several projects the failures can split so BOTH reports are
 *    non-`ok` and NEITHER start writes the marker. So this step takes a SESSION-LEVEL
 *    `pg_advisory_lock` on its own connection BEFORE reading the marker and holds it across
 *    check-marker -> rebuild -> verify -> write-marker. The loser BLOCKS, then re-reads the marker
 *    under the lock: set -> skip and start; absent (the winner failed) -> run the step itself. A
 *    failed attempt leaves NO marker and exits non-zero, so its deploy fails closed and the next
 *    start retries.
 *
 *    The lock is session-level, so it is only sound on a connection this process does not share.
 *    {@link singleConnectionUrl} pins the client's pool to ONE connection for exactly that reason.
 *
 * 2. "SUCCEEDED", NOT "RAN". `ProjectionRebuildOperations.run` catches a failure per
 *    (project, consumer) pair and CONTINUES, so a run can finish with one project's register still
 *    unrepaired. The criterion is therefore the whole of {@link verifyReport}: exit 0, `ok: true`,
 *    `corruptAfter: 0`, `failures: 0`, `results.length === projects` (one consumer), AND
 *    `projects` equal to the live `Project` count read under the same lock.
 *
 * 3. THE DATABASE IS PROVABLY THE CONFIGURED ONE. Every field above is derived from the result set,
 *    so an EMPTY or WRONG database returns `projects: 0, ok: true` and exits 0 having rebuilt
 *    nothing — the self-count is NECESSARY but NOT SUFFICIENT, because it compares two numbers that
 *    came from the same connection. Identity comes from OUTSIDE the connection instead: two
 *    deploy-configured environment variables, {@link ANCHOR_ENV} (a production `Project.id` that
 *    MUST exist in the connected database — ids are unguessable, so a wrong database does not
 *    contain it) and {@link MINIMUM_ENV} (an integer >= 1 that `count(Project)` must meet). The
 *    identity check runs on EVERY start, marker or not, so a later misconfiguration cannot serve.
 *
 * ONE DELIBERATE DEVIATION FROM THE RECORDED SPEC, stated as one. The record makes both variables
 * unconditionally required ("an unset one aborts the deploy"). Taken literally that also refuses
 * the FIRST deploy of a brand-new environment, whose database has no projects and therefore no
 * anchor id to configure — a gate that cannot be cleared. So APPLICABILITY IS DECIDED BY THE
 * DATABASE, in the same schema-aware shape every other preflight in `migrate.sh` already uses, and
 * never by configuration: a database holding ZERO projects is NOT APPLICABLE (generations are per
 * project, so it provably carries none to repair), and a database holding one or more — which every
 * database in service is — REQUIRES both variables and ABORTS without them.
 *
 * Deciding it from the database rather than from a settable value is the point, not an accident. An
 * "allowance" variable — a configured minimum of 0, say — would put the step's own bypass back
 * inside the very configuration the identity check exists to distrust, and a production deploy
 * carrying it would pass while repairing nothing. Nothing this step reads can be set to make it
 * skip a database that has projects; a minimum below 1 is refused outright. And the not-applicable
 * branch is not a vacuous success either: it writes NO marker and claims NO repair, so the next
 * start over a populated database still runs the repair in full.
