-- Phase 5 Task 5A — §E three-way verification: the ONE arrow the verdict makes safe.
--
-- Task 4 stopped the §F transition graph at `under-verification` and said why in as many words:
-- "the STATUSES stay in the CHECK vocabulary because §0's LIVE rule is defined over the whole set;
-- Task 5 adds these arrows WITH the evidence that makes them safe."
--
-- 5A ships the §E verdict, so it opens exactly ONE arrow — `under-verification -> verified` — and
-- not one step further. `certified` stays closed until 5B ships the certificate that is its
-- evidence, and the arrows past it stay closed until Task 6 ships theirs. A status whose evidence
-- does not exist yet is a status nobody can justify.
--
-- No new table, no new column. This migration replaces one trigger function body.
