/**
 * Phase 2 Task 10 — the DRAWINGS module contract (shared, runtime-importable on both sides).
 *
 * The controlled-drawing module is reached ONLY through this contract (its commands + queries) and its
 * published `drawing.*` events. This module defines the SHAPE of that contract — the command names, the
 * query names, and the module-owned HTTP read result — as plain data both the API and the web import.
 * The API validates the command inputs at its request boundary (the Zod schemas in
 * `apps/api/src/contracts.ts`); the module's `DrawingsService`/`DrawingsQueryService` implement the
 * command/query behavior; the boundary check proves no other module reads its persistence directly.
