/**
 * The commit a review comment was POSTED against.
 *
 * GitHub keeps two SHAs on a review comment. `original_commit_id` is the head Codex actually
 * reviewed and never changes. `commit_id` is the newest commit the comment still applies to, and
 * GitHub ADVANCES it every time the branch moves, for every comment whose anchor still resolves.
 *
 * Reading `commit_id` therefore makes yesterday's findings look like a review of today's head: a
 * corrective push inherits every still-anchorable comment from the previous round, the gate fails
 * again, the pull request returns to draft, and the loop can never clear — no review of the new
 * head has happened or is even required for that to occur. Binding to `original_commit_id` asks the
 * question that actually matters: did Codex review THIS head and find something?
 *
 * `commit_id` is the fallback only for a payload that omits the original (older API shapes and
 * hand-written fixtures), so a comment is never silently ignored.
